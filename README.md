# What is this?
This is a project I made during my bootcamp at [Avion School](https://www.avionschool.com/). **The Grape Bank** is a bank (in a way) where *users*' funds are managed by trustworthy *admins* (the visitor of the site). Once you visit the site, it will store dummy admins and users in the localStorage which you can then manage on the website by signing up as an admin. The default password of the dummy admins is `password`.
